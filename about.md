#What's this all about?

We interview other ecologists, evolutionary biologists (and related folks) and find out what tools they use to make their science rock.

#Can I suggest someone I admire?

Sure! Just drop us an email.

#Can I suggest myself?

Of course. In fact just fill out this template and send it back to us. If you are git savvy, then feel free to send us a pull request to this repo.

#How did this idea come about?

We love The Setup and modeled the site after it for our community.
