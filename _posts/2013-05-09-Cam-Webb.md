# Who are you and what do you do?

I am a biologist with research interests ranging from plant ecology
and biogeography to molecular phylogenetics and biodiversity
informatics. I live in Indonesia, and try to help conserve the
magnificent forests of Southeast Asia, and to build local scientific
capacity.

# What hardware do you use?

I’m on the road a lot, and use small laptops rather than desktops. My
last three main machines have been Lenovo
[ThinkPads](http://www.thinkwiki.org/) (X60, X200, X220). For cheap
netbooks for the field, I’ve been impressed with the reliability of
[MSI](http://www.msi.com/).

For phone/mobile technology, I was a Nokia user until recently. The high
point was the wonderful [Maemo](http://maemo.org/)-powered
[N900](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900). I then upgraded to
the very stylish and well-reviewed
[N9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N9), but I’ve decided I simply
dislike the touch interface ubiquitous on just about all phones
and tablets: it’s such a step backwards in terms of precision (fat
fingers) and efficiency (big hand motions needed). At the same time,
Nokia made their terrible decision to drop Maemo/Meego and go with
Windows, so I won’t be getting another Nokia (but good luck
[Jolla](http://jolla.com/)!). I’m currently using a BlackBerry Curve
9320, which I like a lot: cheap(-ish) and capable. Unfortunately, the
harware future looks bleak for a keypad lover!

# What software do you use?

I first installed (Red Hat) GNU/Linux in
[1998](http://linuxcounter.net/user/160056.html) on a brick of a
Toshiba Satellite laptop. I was seduced (back) by MacOS in 2002,
primarily because I wanted an iPod, and with X11 I could do most
Linux-y things I wanted (though the Ctrl vs. ⌘ metakey switching never
ceased to annoy). However, being a proponent of FOSS, and being based
in Indonesia where wages are low and piracy is rife, I felt I should
‘walk the talk,’ and moved back to GNU/Linux, on a ThinkPad. From the
awesome [Gudang Linux](http://gudanglinux.com/) in Jakarta, I bought a
bunch of distro DVDs (Ubuntu, Debian, Slackware, Fedora) and played
around, settling on [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/), partly out of
familiarity with Red Hat. I really like the Fedora community ethos,
and enjoyed their ‘cutting-edge’ distro a lot. However, I didn’t like
the switch to the Gnome 3 interface, and wanted to customize my system
more, reducing the large number of pre-installed packages, and so last
year I decided to go a step further and switched to
[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/). Very pleased I did; Arch has
a great balance between near complete design control and ease. The
Arch Wiki and BBS answer almost every question, and AUR is a great
model for integrating lesser-used software. I’m a bit of a
function-over-form person, and I use the lightweight
[OpenBox](http://openbox.org/) as a window manager, mainly using shell
scripts to manage the system (wifi, disks, processes,
etc.).

I’ve also consolidated my life around
[emacs](http://www.emacswiki.org/), using `gnus` as an email reader,
`dired` as a file manager, and `bbdb` as a PIM. I find the the common
interface and commands to be very efficient, although I can’t deny
having spent a fair amount of time learning the ins and outs of the
extensive emacs world!

For ‘office’ tasks, I use LibreOffice to read `/.docx?/` documents,
although it’s hard to beat the convenience and power of sharing
working documents with GoogleDocs. LibreOffice Calc is my default
spreadsheet. If I can get away with it (i.e., when not collaborating
with non-hackers), I use `latex` for writing complex documents, and
‘markdown’ (with [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)) for everything else. The new ability of
`pandoc` to handle citations almost as well as `bibtex` does means I can
use `markdown`/`pandoc` even more (while I love `latex`, the raw code
can be a pain to remember and read). For citation data:
[JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/). For presentations, I make
`latex` PDFs or [landslide](https://github.com/adamzap/landslide) HTML
pages.

For coding, I still prefer to use
[gawk](http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/) (v.4) for prototyping, and even
for some [production](http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/)
applications. I first learned `awk` on the AIX mainframe while a grad
student, and have found `gawk` to be a fast,
[flexible](http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html),
[powerful](http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawkinet/gawkinet.html)
and friendly tool. A working knowledge of
[regex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) patterns has
also been invaluable on a daily basis. For simulation (loop-heavy)
applications that need to be as fast as possible, I use C
([phylocom](http://phylodiversity.net/phylocom/) and
[shiba](http://phylodiversity.net/shiba/)). I just read Ben Klemens’
[21st Century C](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025108.do),
which was full of great tips (including using
[pthreads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads) for
parallelization). Not surprisingly, I use emacs (with Makefiles) as
the development environment. I also love `git` and
[github](https://github.com/camwebb), as does just about everyone
these days! And for statistical
analysis... [R](http://www.r-project.org/), of course.

For small-scale data management, I love to manipulate plaintext data
into an XML file with an evolving schema, using James Clark’s superb, validating
[nXML mode](http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/) for emacs and
his [trang](http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html) RELAXNG
schema creator and converter. The XML can then be queried with
[xqilla](http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/HomePage) or
[zorba](http://www.zorba-xquery.com/). For larger datasets: MySQL,
managed with phpMyAdmin, and [xataface](http://xataface.com/) to build
a quick web front-end. I’ve also become a big fan of Semantic Web
technology, and like the [4store](http://4store.org/) RDF/graph
database, along with `rapper` and `roqet`
([librdf](http://librdf.org/)) for data manipulation, and
[Protege](http://protege.stanford.edu/) for ontology development.

Other stuff I use all the time: [Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/),
[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/), [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/),
[GThumb](https://live.gnome.org/gthumb),
[GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/), [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/),
[MPlayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/),
[Sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/),
[Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/), [Sigil](https://code.google.com/p/sigil/).

Finally, I have tremendous respect for
[Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/), the web-hosting company I’ve been
with since 2005. It’s just been so much fun to learn web technologies
using their very comprehensive web panel and easy-to-configure tools.
As I’ve gained skills, I now prefer the flexibility of ‘rolling my own’
server (currently with [Amazon WS](http://aws.amazon.com/AWS)), but
still rely on Dreamhost for domain registration, email services, etc.

# What would your dream set up be?

I think I have it already... although I wish my laptop batteries would
last longer!

All joking and pointed digs at MS and Apple aside, I really do marvel
at the Free/Open Source Software culture that has created such
awesome, flexible, creative solutions for our digital age. This
culture has empowered me, and it’s a pleasure to be able to highlight
the tools that have helped me. Thanks for reading this far, and I
hope you find at least one new tool/approach worth adopting.
