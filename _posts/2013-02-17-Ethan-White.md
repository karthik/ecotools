# Who are you and what do you do?

I'm an Associate Professor at Utah State University.  Research in my lab focuses
on using quantitative macroecological approaches including large ecological
databases, advanced statistical methods, and theoretical modeling to understand
ecological systems at large scales.

# What hardware do you use?

I use [System76](https://www.system76.com/) Wild Dog desktops at work and at
home, plus a System76 Lemur laptop for travel and the classroom. I maintain a
small (4 node) cluster of System76 Jackal Pro servers for computationally
intensive work by members of my joint lab group
([Weecology](http://weecology.org)). My primary workspace has an adjustable
height desk ([GeekDesk](http://www.geekdesk.com)). I do most of my computational
work standing and switch to sitting on an exercise ball if my legs need a
break. I also use a
[Kinesis Advantage Keyboard](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm) and
[Evoluent Mouse](https://evoluent.com/) to ease
the strain on my hands of too many hours at the computer.

# What software do you use?

* **Ubuntu Linux:** Just over 4 years ago I made the switch to Linux for all of
    my primary machines and I've never looked back. Once you've used a proper
    package management system the idea that installing software involves more
    than a single call from the command line seems crazy. Especially for a lot
    of scientific software I find that working on Linux just makes life much
    easier and I've noticed that more and more of my students are at least dual
    booting Ubuntu as a result. It's also free, which makes increasingly tight
    lab budgets stretch further, and as a strong proponent of open source in
    science it makes sense to support GNU/Linux.
* **Python:** I am definitely a Pythonista at heart. It may not have the same
    quality of statistical libraries as R, but it's a beautifully designed
    language that has relatively few gotchas and makes it easy to write clean
    maintainable code. As one of the
    [most popular languages in the world](https://github.com/languages) it's
    also very easy to find great libraries for doing almost anything and to get
    help if you're stuck. I use [IPython](http://ipython.org) and the
    [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html),
    which are designed to make scientific computing easy. The Notebook is a
    fantastic way to conduct reproducible science and a great teaching tool.
* **Emacs:** Most of my career I've been an IDE guy, but I recently made the
    switch to one of the power text editors. I really like Emacs and use it
    every day (in fact I'm using it to write the post).
* **Git:** Git has become the defacto standard for version control and GitHub is
    amazing for allowing easy collaboration on scientific projects (both
    [code](https://github.com/weecology/) and
    [papers](https://github.com/PhDP/article_preprint)).
* **Dropbox:** Seamless sinking of all of my work across the 3-5 machines I use
    on a weekly basis. I don't know how I ever lived with out it (well, I do,
    but I've repressed those memories of USB keys and driving back to work late
    at night when I forgot to bring something important home).
* **Drupal:** I've built a few websites and really like Drupal's power and large
    number of well supported modules.
* **R:** I'm not really an R guy myself, but lots of students in our group use
    it for some of their projects. RStudio Server is installed on all of the
    labs servers so that students can easily access the compute power of our
    cluster without dealing with ssh and the terminal if they don't want to.
* **MySQL:** We deal with a lot of large databases in our research and we store
    most of them on a central MySQL server to allow for rapid querying and so
    that we only have to set them up once (instead of every student and postdoc
    repeating the effort themselves). 

# What would your dream set up be?

I really like my current setup, so I'd just make it more so. I'd add solid state
drives, more RAM, and faster chips for all of the machines and I'd get a
standing desk and larger monitors my office. I'd also really like Mac and
Windows servers setup to facility continuous integration testing across
platforms (though of course that wouldn't be a problem if everyone just switched
to Linux :)).
